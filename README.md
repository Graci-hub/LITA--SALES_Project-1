# Sales Data Organization in Excel
### In the Data Organization phase, Excel was used to structure and clean the raw sales data, ensuring it was ready for analysis. The raw dataset contained multiple entries for each transaction, including product names, order dates, regions, quantity, and unit price.
## Key steps in Data organization
- Removing Duplicates: The raw dataset has multiple entries which could have twisted the total sales. I used the excel feature 'Remove duplicates' to eliminate the repetitive rows and to extract the unique datas (i.e Order id's, Customer id's and products).;
- Pivot tables: In Excel, i used pivot tables to group sales by region, year, month and product category, allowing me to quickly spot which areas were underperforming.
